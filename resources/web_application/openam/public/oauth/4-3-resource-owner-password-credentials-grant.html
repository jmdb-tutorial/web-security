    <p>This scenario is intended for public clients i.e. those which are unable to store secrets securely (like a web
        browser). In this case you don't get an authorisation code (because it allows you to get more tokens) and you
        don't get refresh tokens (because you can get more tokens with it. You get given a token and have to keep
        re-authenticating with the authentication server. Depending on the type of activity you might want to limit the
        time exposure for one of these tokens. </p>

    <h4>4.3 Resource owner password credentials grant</h4>


    <p>From <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3" target="resource-owner-credentials-grant">Resource
        owner password credentials grant</a></p>

    <div class="rfc-excerpt">
        <p>The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in
            cases where the resource owner has a trust relationship with the
            client, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged application. The authorization server
            should take special care when
            enabling this grant type and only allow it when other flows are not
            viable.
        </p>
        <p>
            This grant type is suitable for clients capable of obtaining the
            resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using
            an interactive form). It is also used to migrate existing clients
            using direct authentication schemes such as HTTP Basic or Digest
            authentication to OAuth by converting the stored credentials to an
            access token.</p>

        <p><b>4.3.1. Authorization Request and Response</b>

        <p>The method through which the client obtains the resource owner
            credentials is beyond the scope of this specification. The client
            MUST discard the credentials once an access token has been obtained.</p>
