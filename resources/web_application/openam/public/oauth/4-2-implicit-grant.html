    <p>Ok, here we are going to do the flow on the right. In this example we are going to try to redirect back to this page which should have some parameters in the URL.

    <p>This scenario is intended for public clients i.e. those which are unable to store secrets securely (like a web browser). In this case you don't get an authorisation code (because it allows you to get more tokens) and you don't get refresh tokens (because you can get more tokens with it. You get given a token and have to keep re-authenticating with the authentication server. Depending on the type of activity you might want to limit the time exposure for one of these tokens. </p>

    <h4>4.2 Implicit Grant</h4>



    <p>From <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2" target="implicit-grant">Implicit Grant</a></p>

    <div class="rfc-excerpt">
        <p>The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not
            support the issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for public
            clients known to operate a particular redirection URI.  These clients
            are typically implemented in a browser using a scripting language
            such as JavaScript.</p>

        <p>Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
            interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
            browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
            from the authorization server.</p>

        <p>Unlike the authorization code grant type, in which the client makes
            separate requests for authorization and for an access token, the
            client receives the access token as the result of the authorization
            request.</p>

        <p>The implicit grant type does not include client authentication, and
            relies on the presence of the resource owner and the registration of
            the redirection URI.  Because the access token is encoded into the
            redirection URI, it may be exposed to the resource owner and other
            applications residing on the same device.</p>
