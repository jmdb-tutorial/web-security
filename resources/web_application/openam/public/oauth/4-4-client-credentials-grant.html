    <p>This scenario is for confidential clients and can be used to either access information that the client itself owns (perhaps client registration information).
       In this case it is particularly important that the resource server checks the scope of the access token</p>

    <p>From <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4" target="client-credentials-grant">Client credentials grant</a></p>

    <div class="rfc-excerpt">
        <p>
            The client can request an access token using only its client
            credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the
            client is requesting access to the protected resources under its
            control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously
            arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond
            the scope of this specification).
        </p>
        <p>
            The client credentials grant type MUST only be used by confidential
            clients.</p>

        <p><b>4.3.1. Authorization Request and Response</b>

        <p>
        Since the client authentication is used as the authorization grant,
        no additional authorization request is needed.</p>
