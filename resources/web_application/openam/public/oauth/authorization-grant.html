    <p>Ok, here we are going to do the flow on the right. In this example we are going to try to redirect back to this page which should have some parameters in the URL.

    <p>In this scenario we are using a confidential client type which means we are going to pass the client id and secret in the authorize uerl</p>

    <h4>4.1. Authorization Code Grant</h4>

<div class="rfc-excerpt">

   The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access
   tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for <a target="oauth-spec" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.1">confidential clients</a>.
   Since this is a redirection-based flow, the client must be capable of
   interacting with the resource owner's user-agent (typically a web
   browser) and capable of receiving incoming requests (via redirection)
   from the authorization server.
